## OUR GOAL

Our vision is to encorage the use of Blockchain technology, smart meter and smart grids (SG) for trading electricity.
Smart meters are devices that measure and monitor energy consumption in homes and businesses. They are **Important** for reducing energy consumption and carbon emission.
Tron Power is here to utilize blockchain technology to create a secured, transparent and decentrailzed system for monitoring energy consumption and transactions.

### ðŸ•¸ Problem Descriptions

- Limited Automation: The energy industry relies heavily on manual processes, which can be time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. This can lead to delay of transactions and increased cost.
- Limited Innovation: The energy industry has been slow to adopt new technologies and innovations, which can be limit its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs.
- Lack of Transparency: There's lack of transparency which can lead to disputes, fraud and other inefficeinces.
- Centralization: The energy industry is heavily centralized, with few large players dominating the market. This can lead to market ineffiencies, lack of transparency, and limited competition.
- Limitations

### âœ… Solution Approach

We are targeting the three main bodies in trading electriicty

- Prosumer: Someone that produces Energy and consumes Energy
- Consumer: Someone that consumes Energy only
- Producer: Someone that produces Energy only

Our aim is to promote indiviuals to be able to generate renewable energy and sell to either neighbour or grid companies.
Example

> ALICE consumes electriicty from national grid and also makes use of solar panels to generate electricity, if alice is able to generate extra energy alice can easily sign up on tron power as a prosumer and sell his energy to his neighbours.

Why blockchain? Why Tron Power?

- Decentralization: Blockchain technology enables the creation of a decentralized system where energy can be traded directly between producers and consumers without the need for intermediaries. This can increase competition, reduce costs, and increase transparency.
- Elimination of intermediaries: Blockchain technology can eliminate intermediaries such as brokers, utilities, and grid operators by allowing energy producers and consumers to transact directly. This can reduce costs and increase transparency.
- Transparency: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable record of transactions, which can help to reduce disputes, fraud, and other inefficiencies.
- Automation: Blockchain technology can automate many of the manual processes involved in energy trading, reducing the time and cost associated with traditional trading methods. This can also help to reduce the risk of errors and delays.
- Innovation: Blockchain technology provides a platform for innovation, allowing for the development of new business models and the creation of new opportunities forÂ energyÂ trading.

### What TRON POWER OFFERS

- MarketPlace (Showing Prosumers and Producers) allowing prosumers and consumers to buy energy.
- Analytic dashboard that helps prosumers track how much energy has been sold and consumed, consumers track how much energy has been consumed and producers track how much energy has been sold. (A working graph also)

## TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF WORKING PROCESS

- A smart meter system that is made up of a microcontroller (arduino, raspberry pi) that calls the funtion of `SOL ConsumeElectriicty()` on the smart contract.
- A smart contract that handles the way energy is being bought on the blockchain.
- A Web Platform that helps interact with the smart contract and also a dashboard system showing users details about them or their companies.
